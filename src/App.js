Using real examples and code snippets, I discuss ways to use the code review process to improve your code base, reaffirm your team values, and promote a culture of learning.</p>}

AMP uses multiple strategies – pre-loading, caching, async scripts, enforcement of best practices – to achieve a near-instantaneous load of content. Using starter templates, the workshop attendees will walk away with a fully functional AMP page and the knowledge needed to continue creating fast-loading pages.</p>}

Arc Publishing - our inhouse software-as-a-service business has been attracting bigger and bigger media players as clients. Because of Arc's rapid growth combined with industry focus on mobile speed and performance, our engineers have had the chance to implement Accelerated Mobile Pages for several publishers.
